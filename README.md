# javascript-smart-rockets

**javascript-smart-rockets** is an implementation of a genetic algorithm to create "smart rockets" (based on a [simulation] by [Jer Thorp]).

The rockets evolve the "best" path to a target, moving around obstacles and "learning over time". This particular implementation is based on the one proposed by [Daniel Shiffman] in his book [The Nature of Code].

Future
------

* [ ] button for reseting the simulation
* [ ] different types of targets and obstacles
* [ ] allow the user to move targets and obstacles
* [ ] allow the user to chose the number of rockets that spawn in each generation
* [ ] allow the user to change all the parameters of the fitness function
