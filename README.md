# javascript-smart-rockets

**javascript-smart-rockets** is an implementation of a genetic algorithm to create "smart rockets" (based on a [simulation] by [Jer Thorp]). It uses [p5.js] to render all the graphics.

The rockets evolve to find the "best" path to a target, moving around the obstacle and improving over time. This particular implementation is based on the one proposed by [Daniel Shiffman] in his book [The Nature of Code].
